Official NFy Mono news!

It's nice to have news available to you, every day,
after long thought, the NFy NewsScript system (a product of RCBash, a Programming language toolchain) is now available for private use.

It builds files that are written in `news` - This language!

Into JSON and HTML.

The current edit by me allows Markdown instead of HTML. Make the website nicer all around.
